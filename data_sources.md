# Data Sources & Future Enhancements

## Current Data
- DAC installation locations (manually curated)
- Simulated operational data (CO2 capture, energy use, costs)

## Planned Data Collection

1. **DAC Plant Coordinates** — Tabular data for all U.S. installations
2. **Weather/Geographical Data** — Real-time weather, elevation, hydrography for each site
3. **Policy & Investment Data** — State-level DAC incentives and funding
4. **CO2 Emissions by State** — For identifying high-impact deployment locations
5. **ML Site Selection Model** — Predict optimal locations based on weather, geography, and policy
