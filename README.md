Project: Template Direct Air Capture Data Analytics Platform

Objective:
To create an R Shiny app that provides a comprehensive view of various Direct Air Capture projects around the U.S. 

App will include features to visualize real-time and historical data, predictive analytics, and data pre-processing capabilities - hoping to create a skeleton and return to this with larger datasets

Key Features:
- Interactive Dashboard

- A dynamic dashboard displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total CO2 captured, energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and geographical coverage.
Data Preprocessing Module

- Tools for cleaning, normalizing, and integrating DAC data from multiple sources.
Geospatial Analysis

- Interactive maps showing the locations of various DAC installations and their performance metrics.
Time Series Analysis

- Graphs showing the performance of DAC projects over time, with the ability to filter by various parameters.
Predictive Modeling

- Implement machine learning models to forecast the efficiency, costs, and potential impact of different DAC technologies.
Collaboration Tool

- A feature to share insights or directly export graphs and data tables, fostering collaboration between carbon science, data science, and engineering teams.
User Input and Customization

- Allow users to input their data for quick analytics and visualization.

  
Data Requirements:
- Geospatial data for DAC installations.
- Time-series data for CO2 captured, energy used, and other relevant metrics.
- Additional environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, humidity).

Technology Stack:
- R Shiny for the main application.
- R for data preprocessing and analytics.
- leaflet for map visualizations.
- ggplot2 and plotly for other visualizations.
